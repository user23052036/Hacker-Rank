1) If you find any bug feel free to change it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) If you find a better solution (optimal solution) which reduces time and space for a exsiting code, Please add a seperate file and for the solution. So that we can have different appoches to a same problem.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
3) for example if i already had (example.cpp) as a solution and if you dont find any bug in the code but have a better solution just add another file in the same directory name (example2.cpp)
